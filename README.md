# Anime Recommender System using SVD
This project builds an anime recommendation system using the Surprise SVD algorithm. The system identifies the most popular anime and predicts user ratings based on historical review data. A filtered subset of anime with at least 500 user reviews is used to ensure relevance and reliability.

The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and generation of predicted ratings for recommendation purposes.

## Project Overview
Anime platforms generate large amounts of user rating data, which can be leveraged to build personalized recommendation systems.
This project applies collaborative filtering using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict how users would rate specific anime titles.

The objective is to recommend popular and relevant anime based on historical patterns.

## Workflow
1. Import Libraries
```
import pandas as pd
from surprise import SVD
from surprise.model_selection import cross_validate
from surprise.dataset import Dataset
from surprise.reader import Reader
```
2. Load and Prepare Dataset
* Load anime ratings and metadata
* Filter anime with ≥ 500 reviews
* Convert data into Surprise-compatible format using `Reader` and `Dataset.load_from_df()`

3. Train SVD Model
- Apply Surprise SVD algorithm
- Perform cross-validation to evaluate performance
- Generate predicted ratings for user–anime pairs

4. Build Recommendation Output
- Identify the top 50 most popular anime
- Predict user ratings
- Generate ranked recommendation lists

## Key Results
- Successfully compiled a list of 50 popular anime based on review counts.
- The SVD model performed well in predicting user ratings according to cross-validation results.
- Recommendations were generated by ranking predicted ratings and selecting the highest-rated anime for each user.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Surprise Library (SVD, Dataset, Reader)
